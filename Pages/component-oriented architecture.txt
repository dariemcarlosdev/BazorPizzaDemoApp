In Blazor, a parent component and a child component are part of the component-oriented architecture. 
A Blazor application comprises multiple small and large Blazor components forming a component tree.

A parent component:

is responsible for storing and updating the root state. It renders before its child components. 
It can pass parameters to child components and also manage the state of the parent itself and its children.

A child component:

is responsible for executing the business logic or part of it. It can be reused in another component. 
The state is shared by passing parameters from the parent to the child component. 
A child component can also communicate with its parent component by invoking a callback within a method.

For example, in a Blazor Server application, you might have a parent component that includes a child component like this:

C#

<!-- ParentComponent.razor -->
<div>
    <h2>Parent Component</h2>
    <ChildRazorComponent @ref="childComponentRef" />
</div>

@code {
    private ChildRazorComponent childComponentRef;
}

In this example, ChildRazorComponent is included in the markup of ParentComponent. The @ref directive is used to create a reference (childComponentRef) to the instance of ChildRazorComponent. 
This allows the parent component to interact with the child component directly
